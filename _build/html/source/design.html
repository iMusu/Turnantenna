<h1>The Design<a class="headerlink" href="#the-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This project is intended to solve particular problems in specific circumstances. Later developments evolved
the original idea to make it more flexible in different situations, but some characteristics remained the same.
The following pages will provide a more detailed explanation of those starting points.</p>
<p>For the mechanical study, made under current laws, two effects were considered: the gravity and the wind.
European standards Eurocodes were used to estimate the effects of the wind.</p>
<p>The last part of the chapter is provided a list of constructive solutions adopted.</p>
<div class="section" id="design-boundaries">
<h2>Design boundaries<a class="headerlink" href="#design-boundaries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="a">First and foremost, The Turnantenna is intended to help WCN volunteers. As said in the previous chapter,
WCN people could be unskilled, or be not sufficiently equipped for being able to replicate a complex
structure. That is the reason why the Turnantenna must be made of very cheap and readily available
hardware, and its replication should be error tolerant to construction errors [A].</p>
<p id="b">It was already said that the Turnantenna will be self-rotating to get WMN dynamic. However, in practice
networks are frequently suited on lands where topography is variable and, in the situation where nodes are
on different altitudes, antennas needs to be tilted by a certain angle to provide an effective link. For that
reason, a proper rotation of one antenna should involve two different axis: in the horizontal and vertical
direction. The antenna will be able to turn up to 180 degrees and 13 degrees respectively [B].</p>
<p id="c">Another consideration comes from a common manufacturing practice. For directional antennas like the one
used for this project, the most typical attaching points are vertical poles. Antennas have a particular shape
that makes easy the fixing to a tube-like support. Since the system discussed here is an upgrade of that, it
was decided to preserve this characteristic in order to maintain compatibility with older systems [C].</p>
<p id="d">The intent of the project is to make the Turnantenna system usable almost everywhere. The most significant
environmental aspect is the wind, so it was assumed that the worst working conditions correspond to a
wind blowing at 37,5 m/s (135 km/h) [D].</p>
<p id="e">Some other requisites comes from a practical consideration. The Turnantenna is designed to host different
antenna models, but, at the moment, this study is based on a particular one: the Ubiquity NanoStation M5
which weights 400g, is 80mm wide, 294mm high, and 65mm deep. All the forces and the stresses are a
correlate with the specific geometry of this antenna [E].</p>
<p>Lastly, one important feature is the cable management of the electronics. In Ninux, like in many other WMN,
the node configuration follows the “ground routing” scheme: that imply the presence of a single cable that
runs from the router to the Turnantenna, which both bring signals to the antenna and power to the
electronics. More information about the ground routing could be found in the next sub-chapter.</p>
<p id="f">Such a configuration can be set up using a power over Ethernet (POE) injector. For this project a POE
injector capable of supplying 24W (1A at 24V) is used. Considering a power consumption of 12W for the
NanoStation antenna and 5W for the single-board computer (for more details on the electrical scheme see
the chapter 3 - ), the remaining 7W shall be sufficient for both the engines [F].</p>
<div class="section" id="ground-routing">
<h3>Ground routing <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a><a class="headerlink" href="#ground-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ground routing in a WMN is a node configuration where all the traffic activity is managed by a daemon that
is installed in a single device, called <em>ground router</em>.</p>
<p>In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background
process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Practically, in ground routing all the network administration (like decision-making about the best route to
follow to send a packet from A to B, error handling, reaction to unexpected mesh changes, ecc.) is
performed by the ground router while the antenna works just like a repeater, and it can only send or receive
data without having any decision-making power.</p>
<p>This is a Ninux community choice, since the routing daemon could be installed in the antenna firmware;
doing this, part of traffic management could be performed by the antenna. Therefore, in this second
scenario antennas play an active role in the route-decision computing.</p>
<p>Ground routing is a good choice for different reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>flexibility for the hardware adopted: for the reasons listed before, router and antennas choice is almost
free. Firmware and routing protocols could be adopted according to personal needs without the
necessity of dealing with software compatibility with the preferred networking daemon;</li>
<li>performances: in ground routing there is a single daemon instance per router; in other schemes there
are one per antenna. In this second case, number of players in the routing management play increases
exponentially, producing a significantly decrease of the entire network performance. That happens
every time a network event occurs (like a node get off) and all the managing actors have to have
learned about this. The more are the actors, the more is the internal traffic produced to reach everyone,
and the less are the unallocated resources available for network users.</li>
<li>flexibility of the network: antennas and routers have very different computational capabilities. If
antennas host the networking daemon, they could contain a smaller number of features due to the
minor memory and less data processing capability of the antenna. Moreover, antennas are onto roofs,
pylons or others; routers are into houses and offices instead. When it comes the time of making a big
change in the meshing devices, the effort to reach the ones or the others will be significantly different.</li>

<div class="section" id="norms">
<span id="eurocodes"></span><h2>Norms<a class="headerlink" href="#norms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The effect of the wind is calculated according to the <em>Eurocode 1</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f3" id="id3">[3]</a>, following the guidelines indicated in the
Leonardo da Vinci Pilot Project’s handbook <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f4" id="id4">[4]</a>. In this study the wind will be considered quasi-static, namely
without taking into account dynamic and aeroelastic effects.</p>
<div class="section" id="peak-wind-pressure">
<h3>Peak wind pressure<a class="headerlink" href="#peak-wind-pressure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the main parameters in the determination of wind actions on structures is the characteristic peak
wind pressure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_p\)</span>, which is influenced by local factors (e.g. terrain roughness and orography/terrain
topography) and the height above terrain. The peak wind pressure accounts for the mean pressure (basic
pressure) and a turbulence component.</p>
<p>To find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_b\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_p\)</span> has to be evaluated first with the following formula.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[v_b = c_{dir} \cdot c_{season} \cdot v_{b,0}\]</div>
<p>The fundamental value of the basic wind velocity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{b,0}\)</span>, is the characteristic 10 minutes mean wind velocity,
irrespective of wind direction and time of year, at 10m above ground level in open country terrain with low
vegetation such as grass and isolated obstacles with separations of at least 20 obstacle heights. These
characteristic values correspond to annual probabilities of exceedence of 0,02 which corresponds to a
return period of 50 years.</p>
<p>The norm distinguish situations where the wind has a particular prevalent direction, and where its speed
changes seasonally. In this project, due to the unpredictability of those factors, either the coefficients
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_{season}\)</span> will be taken unitary.</p>
<p>The following relationship exists between the basic velocity and the basic pressure:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[q_b = \frac{ \rho} 2 \cdot v_b^2\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> is the air density (can be set to 1,25 kg/m<sup>3</sup> )</p>
<p id="g">The basic value of the velocity pressure has to be transformed into the value at the reference height of the
considered structure. Velocity at a relevant height and the gustiness of the wind depend on the terrain
roughness. The roughness factor describing the variation of the speed with height has to be determined in
order to obtain the mean wind speed at the relevant height. Note that the Eurocode 1 maximum value for
the height is 200 m [G].</p>
<p>The roughness factor related to a minimum height <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z_{min}\)</span> for the calculation is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{array}{lcl} c_r(z) = k_r \cdot ln \left( \frac z {z_0} \right), &amp; \mbox{but} &amp; z \geq z_{min}  \\
k_r = 0,19 \cdot \left( \frac {z_0} {z_{0,II}} \right) ^{0,07} &amp; &amp; \end{array}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_r\)</span> = terrain factor</li>
<li><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z_0\)</span> = roughness length</li>

<p>In case of general assumption, the gust pressure (or peak pressure) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_p (z)\)</span> at the reference height of the
considered terrain category is calculated with the:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[q_p(z) = q_b \cdot c_r(z)^2 \cdot \left[ 1+ \frac 7 {ln \left( \frac z {z_0} \right) } \right]\]</div>
<p>Given the uncertainty of both the wind conditions and environment where the Turnantenna will be mounted,
to find a design value for the peak pressure will be considered the worst reasonable case.</p>
<p>The basic speed was specified before <a class="reference internal" href="#d"><span class="std std-ref">[D]</span></a>; the height above terrain is taken pair to the maximum permissible
value <a class="reference internal" href="#g"><span class="std std-ref">[G]</span></a>, and it was considered that the strongest wind is felt in open lands:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_b = 37,5\ m/s\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z = 200\ m\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Terrain\ category = 0\)</span></p>
<p>Now, following the previous proceeding, the peak wind pressure could be easily found:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_p = 4300 \frac N {m^2}\)</span></p>
<p>As next step, the norm suggests to correct this value in case of particular stressing situations (e.g. buildings
on top of hills and ridges, surrounding constructions that work like convergent nozzles, ecc.). However, in
this case there is no possibility to take into account all the random peculiarities of all the different possible
scenarios, but is not even possible to exclude such of situations.</p>
<p>A better option is to consider the values of the mean speed indicated by the European wind Atlas <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f5" id="id5">[5]</a>, which
subdivides the European territory in five zones. The following map (Figure 2-1 Distribution
of wind resources in Europe. By means of the legend the available wind energy at a height of 50 metres can be
estimated for five topographic conditions. Regions where local concentration effects may occur are not
indicated.) resumes those values:</p>

</div>
<p>In the atlas, the maximum speed value is 11,5 m/s. The design wind speed is 37,5 m/s <a class="reference internal" href="#d"><span class="std std-ref">[D]</span></a> instead. The
safety coefficient results over than 3,2. This is considered enough to conclude that the peak pressure was
determined with an appropriate safety margin.</p>

<h3>Wind Forces<a class="headerlink" href="#wind-forces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In simplified terms, the force exerted by the wind on the antenna is given by:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[F_w = q_p \cdot A \cdot C_f\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_f\)</span> is the force coefficient, the equivalent of the drag coefficient known in fluid dynamics. The Eurocode 1
gives the following definition:</p>

<p>The wind could blow either frontal or by side, so the two cases will be studied separately.</p>
<p>Starting from a frontal blowing wind, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b/d\)</span> ratio results to be equal to 2,6 , which determines a value of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{f,0}\)</span> pair to 1,3.</p>
<p>With a side wind, the ratio become 0,38 , with a consequent value of 2,1 for the force coefficient.</p>
<p>The shape of the antenna is asymmetric, and is neither a square nor a rounded shape. For that reason, the
reduction factor could be considered as the mean of the two mid-shapes. For a perfect square section the
factor is unitary, while for the rounded corners case (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = 15\ mm\)</span>) it results pair to 0,5. The mean value is
0,75.</p>
<p>The global force coefficient, in the worst case, is:</p>

a magnitude of the stress that every component will have to resist to.</p>
<p>First of all, the forces will be discussed and estimated; after that, a general analysis of the distribution of
the internal forces will be presented to provide a set of equations useful to find forces and moments in all
the structure. The reason of this approach is that the Turnantenna is open source, and everyone shall be

work. Lastly, most critical pieces will be verified.</p>

<h3>External forces evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#external-forces-evaluation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using the <a class="reference internal" href="#eurocodes"><span class="std std-ref">Eurocode</span></a> approach, it was possible to find the pressure of the wind and the drag
coefficient. In the most general case, the wind could blows in all directions. Furthermore, wind from both
sides produces the same effects on the structure, and rear wind could be considered basically equivalent
to frontal wind. The β angle is introduced to characterize the wind direction, which is considered always
horizontal; for symmetry, it’s sufficient to study the effects in a quarter-turn domain.</p>
<p>The β angle is defined as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{cases} \beta = 0, &amp; \mbox{side wind} \\
              0 &lt; \beta &lt; \frac \pi 2, &amp; \mbox{general wind} \\

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 2-6  Explanation of the β angle</span></p>
</div>
<p>To evaluate the wind effects, the force it is divided into two components, one orthogonal and one tangential
to the face of the antenna:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}R_n = q_p \cdot c_f \cdot \sin \beta \cdot A_{A,n}\\R_{\tau} = q_p \cdot c_f \cdot \cos \beta \cdot A_{A,\tau}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_n\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{\tau}\)</span> are the frontal and the side area of the antenna; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_p\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_f\)</span>
are the peak wind pressure and the force coefficient found in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>This study is based on the following hypothesis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the mobile frame LEFM (Figure 2-7) is a rectangular section tube t × k;</li>
<li>the force developed by the action of the wind on the rockers and the horizontal extensions of the frame
is negligible:</li>
<li>the antenna will be sketched as two parallelepipeds jointed together:<ul>
<li>A prims with the dimensions of the antenna itself <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((w_A \cdot h_A)\)</span></li>
<li>A smaller one that takes into account the contribute of the two supports <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((w_A \cdot h_A) / 2\)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make it clear, the sketch used to perform the calculus is shown in Figure 2-7 , while the real mobile
frame is very similar to Figure 2-6.</p>

<p>The vertical axis of rotation is in the middle between the vertical face of the frame and the antenna. The
pressure acting on these two areas will cause the birth of two parallel forces with opposite direction. That’s
why the two areas need to be considered separately.</p>
<p>Areas values result:</p>

of the wind pressure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_n\)</span>, and the internal forces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{21}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{31}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The bar number 2 is hinged on both the ends, consequently <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{21}\)</span> corresponds to the physical angle γ. The force
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{31}\)</span> will have its same direction, that is not align with the beam 3; it’s identified by the angle
φ which has not a direct connection with the physical angle δ.</p>
<p>The following equations are valid since the beam is in a state of equilibrium:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{array}{rl}
   x ] &amp; F_{21} \cdot \sin \gamma + F_{31} \cdot \sin \varphi = R_n \\

   M_{(B)} ] &amp; R_n \cdot \frac h 2 \cdot \cos \theta - P_A \cdot \frac h 2 \cdot \sin \theta -
                                                   F_{21} \cdot h \cdot \sin{(\gamma + \theta)} = 0
\end{array}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>which can give the following expressions:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{array}{c}
   F_{21} = \frac {\frac {R_n} 2 \cdot \cos \theta - \frac {P_A} 2 \cdot \sin \theta } {\sin (\gamma + \theta)} \\
   F_{31} = \frac {R_n - F_{21} \cdot \sin \gamma} {\sin \varphi} \\

<h4>Generic wind direction<a class="headerlink" href="#generic-wind-direction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In this part, the effect of a lateral wind will be taken into account. At this point it is necessary to consider the
whole effect of the wind as the β angle changes.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{cases}
   \theta \in [-6°, 7°] \\

<p>To study the structure when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta ≠ \frac \pi 2\)</span>, the principle of superposition of the effects allows to re-use the resulting
equations of the previous part, and to sum the side wind effects in order to obtain a complete analysis.</p>
<p>To get the problem single-variable, the reader should know that, in the next chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="#internal-stress"><span class="std std-ref">“Internal stress determination”</span></a>, maximum stresses are obtained when the pitch angle is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta =-6°\)</span>. This is valid for every wind speed values and for all directions.</p>
<p>In summary, the pitch angle will be kept fixed, while β changes, because a change in the β angle produce
the exactly same output as a change in the yaw angle. Applying this approach, the study results to be very
fast and with no loss of reliability.</p>
<p>A lateral wind cause the birth of a moment <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_2\)</span> which, as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_1\)</span> , represent the torque exerted by the
secondary engine to maintain the antenna in the desired position when wind blows. The characterising force of this
moment is the tangential component of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> , the application point distance depends on the particular
geometrical schematization.</p>
<p>Introducing a reference system λ − κ with the origin Q placed at the centre height on the left corner of the
antenna block (Figure 2-13), with the axis tilted at θ angle, positive for left-to-right and bottom-to-top
directions, the λ coordinate of the centre of mass is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\lambda_{G_2} = \frac {\sum ^N _{i=1} S_{κ, i}} {A_{tot}} =

<p>Note: during the following analysis, the effects of the wind on the antenna will not be taken into account,
since the device is not under design, and it was not possible to access to any information about its
mechanical behaviour under stress.</p>
<p>With a perfect frontal wind, that blows ad 37,5 m/s and develop a pressure of 4300 Pa with a drag coefficient
of 1,6 , it is possible to use the equations showed in the previous chapter “<a class="reference internal" href="#static-analysis"><span class="std std-ref">Static analysis</span></a>”
to plot the following graph:</p>
<div class="figure">

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Torques graph for a frontal wind" src="../_images/graph_frontal2.png" />
</div>
<p>As first clear conclusion, the most critical condition appears to be the one corresponding to the angle
θ = −6°. Moreover, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_n\)</span> is a monotonic increasing function of the β angle, and a change of β will change the
scale, but will not affect the overall trend the functions shown in the graphs above.</p>
<p>In light of this, it is sufficient to consider a fixed value for θ, and change β.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Forces graph for a lateral wind" src="../_images/graph_lateral.png" />
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Torques graph for a lateral wind" src="../_images/graph_lateral2.png" />
</div>
<p>In these last two graphs, it emerges a practical consideration: while the particular geometry allows to have
a very low torque on the second engine (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_2\)</span>), the most critical component, in case of side wind, is the rocker
linked to the first engine (beam 3), which has to bear the action of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_13\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_34\)</span>.</p>
<p>The most stressful working conditions are two:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the one corresponding to a frontal wind: θ = −6° and β = 90°</li>
<li>the one with a completely side wind: θ = −6° and β = 0</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to give a more clear representation of the stress distribution in the following section will be shown
the load charts. The first load configuration is the following:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 2-18  Load configuration for θ = −6° and β = 90°</span></p>

<p>The principle of superposition of the effects allows to study the second load configuration in a double-step
procedure. Since the frontal wind is absent, the two addends of the sum will be the weight and side wind.</p>
