The Turnantenna was born to improve robustness and reliability in Wireless Community Networks, and allows you to move, access and point a directional antenna without having to climb onto the roof, the pylon, the pole or wherever the antenna in mounted.

The opportunity of automatically re-pointing the antenna trough remote control appears to be an immediate and significant advantage now and when developing WCN further. With the Turnantenna you can make tests, fix network problems, and much more without any effort.
