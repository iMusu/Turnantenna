Welcome to Turnantenna's documentation!
=======================================
:Author: Marco Musumeci

The Turnantenna project is a `Ninux <ninux.org>`_ IoT experiment. The original idea came from the mind of Salvatore
Moretti, whom developed the very first prototype with Edoardo Putti and started this project. I met Salvatore and
Edoardo during the weekly Ninux meet-ups in Florence (IT) and I started working of his idea applying my mechanical
knowledge.
Few months later Leonardo Maccari proposed me to apply to the Google Summer of Code with this project, and I accepted.
In the mean time, in 2018, we brought the Turnantenna at the `Merge-it@Turin <https://merge-it.net/>`_ and at the
`WirelessMeshUp@Berlin <https://www.wireless-meshup.org/doku.php>`_, and we'll bring it to the
`Maker Faire@Rome <http://2018.makerfairerome.eu/en/>`_.
I graduated in the middle of the GSOC, and combined the work of my mechanical engineering thesis, with
the software development required by Google.

The entire work is described here, and here we'll continuously make updates and link new references. If you'd like to
